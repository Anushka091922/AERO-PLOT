# AERO-PLOT
 AERO-Plot, a project, focusing on real-time mapping and tracking of drone movements. Drawing inspiration from modern drone technology, the project aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of drone navigation and spatial awareness during flight. In addition to that, Utilized advanced mapping logic to accurately record the drone's movement based on speed and angular speed, enabling precise distance and angle calculations during flight and Designed a dynamic path visualization system that displayed the drone's flight path in a graphical format, aiding in the visualization and analysis of the drone's movements
